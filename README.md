## How can I best test React component callbacks? (Using Meteor/Velocity/Jasmine)

This repo contains a somewhat clunky way of testing a React component's callback value to a parent component.  I am interested in finding a better way of doing this.


**Solved**
A better of doing this is to use a Jasmine spy. [Learn more](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35491361/what-is-a-good-way-of-testing-react-component-callbacks-to-parent-components)

To run:
- ```curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh```
-  Clone this repo, then ```cd app && meteor```
